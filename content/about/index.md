The Computer Science Student Union, or CSSU for short, represents over 1200 Computer Science students who are either taking a Computer Science course or are part of a Computer Science POSt at the University of Toronto St. George campus. We are a student governed body that receives funding from the Arts and Sciences' Student Union, the Department of Computer Science, and our union store. The description of the structure, rules, and processes of the union are described in our [**constitution**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BtoaF5GL-9pxtXPqgN0domckNSJyOE3V/view?usp=sharing).

# Our Lounge @ BA 2250

!["CSSU Lounge"](cssu_lounge.png)

The CSSU proudly maintains a student lounge in which students can hang out, network, play games and ask questions. Office operations volunteers manage the lounge, store, and help answer questions about the undergraduate student experience. A sign-up form will be posted soon to schedule weekly office hours. Check back soon!

_The lounge is currently closed due to COVID-19 public health guidelines. We expect to reopen in late-September._

## Store

We sell many food items in our in-lounge store for your convenience. Anyone can come by during open hours and purchase a snack or beverage using cash or card (for purchases of $1 or more). Please be kind to the person assisting you with your purchase at the desk; they are a volunteer!
