The CSSU proudly maintains a student lounge in BA 2250 in which students can hang out, network, play games and ask questions. Office operations volunteers help manage the lounge, the store/stockroom, kitchen, gaming centre, and study spaces. They also assist in answering questions and directing students to appropriate resources. Members of the Executive and General Councils also generally serve shifts in office operations.

## Store

We sell many food items in our in-lounge store for your convenience. Anyone can come by during open hours and purchase a snack or beverage using cash (unavailable due to COVID-19) or card (for purchases of $1 or more). Please be kind to the person assisting you with your purchase at the desk; they are a volunteer! A full list of store items will be uploaded here soon.

## Schedule (November/December 2021)
