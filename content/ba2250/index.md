### Library

Over the years, we've collected many books from generous (or forgetful!) students, and we proudly maintain a new cozy home for them. We hope that our library shelf provides more accessibility to student learning and curiosity. Students can read in the study space, or borrow a book out with a piece of UofT/govrenment ID. If you'd like to donate a book, please speak to the office manager on duty!
