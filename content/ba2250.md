# Our Lounge @ BA 2250

!["CSSU Lounge"](/images/cssu_lounge.png)

The CSSU proudly maintains a student lounge in which students can hang out, network, play games and ask questions. Office operations volunteers manage the lounge, store, and help answer questions about the undergraduate student experience. A sign-up form will be posted soon to schedule weekly office hours. Check back soon!

_The lounge is currently closed due to COVID-19 public health guidelines. We expect to reopen in late-September._

## Store

We sell many food items in our in-lounge store for your convenience. Anyone can come by during open hours and purchase a snack or beverage using cash or card (for purchases of $1 or more). Please be kind to the person assisting you with your purchase at the desk; they are a volunteer!
