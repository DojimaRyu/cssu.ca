# Results (April 11, 2022)

Dear students,

After a difficult year and campaigning period, many of you are wondering about last weekend's general election results. Today, I hope to give an overdue explanation.

The voter list was provided to us by the [Department of Computer Science](https://web.cs.toronto.edu) and sent to [UofT Student Life](https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/) for upload onto the [voting platform](https://voting.utoronto.ca/). It was not until the voting period began when the Chief Returning Officer (CRO), Roland Gao, discovered that several students who should have been ineligible still voted. Membership and voter eligibility are derived from Section 1.2 of [our constitution](https://www.cssu.ca/constitution.pdf) and the requirement to pay the [Arts \& Science Student Union (ASSU)](https://assu.ca/) fee is particularly important. Students on their Professional Experience Year (PEY) or in part-time studies who do not pay this fee are not eligible to vote; the existence of said students who nonetheless voted has led us to believe the voter list was incorrect. You may recall that [last year, we encountered the inverse problem](https://www.facebook.com/UofTCSSU/posts/3789581304462005) where the voter list was correct but the then CRO, convinced otherwise, reset the vote to consult with the ASSU. Due to our time and constitutional constraints this election, the CRO has decided (with the consent of the ASSU administration, candidates, and current Executive Council) to exceptionally accept the results of the original vote despite the incorrect voter list.

With that said, I will now announce the long-awaited results. A total of 219 votes were cast.

- _President_: **Aditya Goyal (102 votes)**, Jenny Xu (91 votes), 26 _spoiled_.
- _Vice-President_: **Joshua Ong (169 votes)**, 50 _spoiled_.
- _Treasurer_: **Aditya Mehrotra (149 votes)**, 70 _spoiled_.
- _Director of Social Events_: **Victor Gasnikov (124 votes)**, Vaibhav Holani (34 votes), 61 _spoiled_.
- _Director of Academic Events_: Arkaprava Choudhury (86 votes), **Jessica Wang (92 votes)**, 41 _spoiled_.
- _Director of Internal Relations_: **Mogtaba Alim (142 votes)**, Sannat Bhasin (24 votes), 53 _spoiled_.
- _Director of External Relations_: **Akiki Liang (167 votes)**, 52 _spoiled_.

Please join me in congratulating Aditya Goyal, Joshua Ong, Aditya Mehrotra, Victor Gasnikov, Jessica Wang, Mogtaba Alim, and Akiki Liang in their election to the CSSU Executive Council for the 2022/2023 academic year. They will officially take office when the current Executive Council's term expires in the first week of May; we wish them the best of luck! For any outstanding questions/concerns regarding the election, please [contact the CRO](mailto:roland.gao@mail.utoronto.ca).

We thank all candidates for their interest in and dedication to improving the undergraduate experience. They showcased a lot of passion for our community, and I encourage those unsuccessful to join the General Council to assist in initiatives and represent more of the student body. I would also like to thank Roland for his hard work as CRO, and the students who casted a vote this month; your active participation means a lot.

Sincerely,

Robert (Rupert) Wu {{< newLine >}}
