"Imagination embraces the entire world, and all there ever will be to know and understand", as stated by Albert Einstein. It's what is able to take our minds beyond the norm, where strings of thought are spun together into a tapestry of ideas, innovations, questions and answers. While often undervalued when compared to testable knowledge, the impact of imagination in our everyday lives may be deeper than we expect.

For the 20th anniversary of UTism (the University of Toronto Interdisciplinary Symposium on the Mind), CASA (the Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence Students Association) brings to you a conference which will aim to examine the interplay between imagination and the mind through various interdisciplinary fields. This year's UTism invites you to imagine the possibility of imagination through contemporary research in philosophy, psychology, computer science, neuroscience, and linguistics.

If you are interested in learning about top-level research pertaining to our theme, talking to various professors coming from around the world, and also talking to alumni from 20 years ago about anything including career paths, your attendance at this symposium will be of utmost benefit! 

The conference will take place on February 10-11, 11am - 5pm, 2024. Admission for UofT students is 10$, and general admission is 15$. More information concerning the event, including the speakers, topics, schedule, and more, follow us on IG: casa.uoft!
