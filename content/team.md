### Office Operations

Office operations volunteers help manage the lounge, the store/stockroom, kitchen, gaming centre, and study spaces in the student loung in BA 2250. They also assist in answering questions and directing students to appropriate resources. Members of the Executive and General Councils also generally serve shifts in office operations.

_As the lounge is currently closed, we do not have an office operations team. Applications are expected to be posted in late-September._
