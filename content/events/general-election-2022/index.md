The nomination period for the CSSU Executive Council for the 2022-2023 academic term has begun!

We continued to engage and strengthen the Computer Science community despite the remote learning setting. I encourage everyone interested in making the Computer Science community better to run for one of the following positions:

- President
- Vice-President
- Treasurer
- Director of Social Events
- Director of Academic Events
- Director of Internal Relations
- Director of External Relations
