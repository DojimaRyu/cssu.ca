Hey CSSU community! It's recruiting season so you're probably figuring out how to apply for internships, refreshing your resume, and/or practicing interview questions. CSSU will be hosting a series of job hunting events to bring you one step closer to attaining the job of your dreams! So far, we've confirmed student experts from companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, Intel, etc. so you don't want to miss out on their valuable insight. Come and join us!

## Details

To get the most out of our events, attend each one as they're all essential parts of the job application sequence. The Zoom link will be provided closer to the date of the event through the email you use to sign up.
