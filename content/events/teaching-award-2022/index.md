It's the end of the year, and time for the yearly CSSU Teaching Awards! This past year has been exceptionally challenging for the faculty. With the remote setting and transition to in-person learning, our Computer Science faculty has been working hard trying their best to provide a good experience. The professor(s) who get the most votes in proportion to the number of students they teach this year receive a recognition award from the whole CS Undergraduate community!

Show appreciation to your favourite Computer Science Professor this year by filling out [this form](https://forms.gle/NryGyhGjENYtamhK7) to cast your vote by April 3rd! Thank you!

By filling out the form, you will be entered into a raffle for three 15$ Starbucks gift cards!
